# GANProject
Developed for TIS4021

The code of the implementation is located in **face_generate.py**.
**gan.h5** contains the weights that Keras used for the last training step.
**iterations.txt** contains the number of iterations that the GAN stopped with.

*CelebA* dataset used: http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html

For running the program:
```
python3 face_generate.py
```
- To run the program from the beginning of the iterations, **gan.h5** and **iterations.txt**.
